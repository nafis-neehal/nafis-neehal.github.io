  abstract={Artificial Intelligence has become the new powerhouse of data analytics in this 
  technological era. With advent of different Machine Learning and Computer Vision algorithms, 
  applying them in data analytics has become a common trend. However, applying Deep Neural Networks 
  in different sport data analyzing tasks and study the performance of these models is yet to be explored. 
  Hence, in this paper, we have proposed a 13 layered Convolutional Neural Network referred as “Shot-Net” 
  in order to classifying six categories of cricket shots, namely Cut Shot, Cover Drive, Straight Drive, 
  Pull Shot, Scoop Shot and Leg Glance Shot. Our proposed model has achieved fairly high accuracy with low cross-entropy rate.},

  abstract={Biometric Authentication has become a very popular method for different state-of-the-art 
  security architectures. Albeit the ubiquitous acceptance and constant development in trivial biometric 
  authentication methods such as fingerprint, palm-print, retinal scan etc., the possibility of producing highly 
  competitive performance from somewhat less-popular methods still remains. Electrocardiogram (ECG) based multi-staged 
  biometric authentication is such a method, which, despite its limited appearance in earlier research works, 
  are currently being observed as equally high-performing as other trivial popular methods. The identification 
  stage of this method suffers from requiring a high runtime, due to cross-matching of the new data with every 
  single template data stored in the database, especially when dealing with huge amount of data. To solve this 
  unaddressed problem, in this paper, we have proposed a K-means clustering based novel method where all the template 
  data are clustered based on similarity, and only the most similar data cluster is searched instead of 
  whole dataset during the identification event. Using our method we have achieved a maximum of 79.26% time reduction with 100% accuracy.},

  abstract={Pose detection estimate human activity in images or video frames using computer vision technique. 
  Pose detection has many applications, such as body to augmented reality, fitness, animation etc. 
  ExNET represents a way to detect human pose from 2D human exercises image using Convolutional Neural Network. 
  In recent time Deep Learning based systems are making it possible to detect human exercise poses from images. 
  We refer to the model we have built for this task as ExNET: Deep Neural Network for Exercise Pose Detection. 
  We have evaluated our proposed model on our own dataset that contains a total of 2000 images. 
  And those images are distributed into 5 classes as well as images are divided into training and test dataset, 
  and obtained improved performance. We have conducted various experiments with our model on the test dataset, 
  and finally got the best accuracy of 82.68%},

  abstract={We introduce CTBench, a benchmark to assess language models (LMs) in aiding
            clinical study design. Given metadata specific to a study, CTBench examines
            how well AI models can determine the baseline features of the clinical trial (CT)
            which include demographic and relevant features collected at the start of the trial
            from all participants. The baseline features, typically presented in CT publications
            (often as Table 1), are crucial for characterizing study cohorts and validating
            results. Baseline features, including confounders and covariates, are also required
            for accurate treatment effect estimation in studies involving observational data.
            CTBench consists of two datasets: "CT-Repo", containing baseline features from
            1, 690 clinical trials sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, and "CT-Pub", a subset
            of 100 trials with more comprehensive baseline features gathered from relevant
            publications. We develop two LM-based evaluation methods for evaluating the
            actual baseline feature lists against LM-generated responses. “ListMatch-LM”
            and “ListMatch-BERT” use GPT-4o and BERT scores (at various thresholds),
            respectively, to perform the evaluation. To establish baseline results, we apply
            advanced prompt engineering techniques using LLaMa3-70B-Instruct and GPT-4o
            in zero-shot and three-shot learning settings to generate potential baseline features.
            We validate the performance of GPT-4o as an evaluator through human-in-the-loop 
            evaluations on the CT-Pub dataset, where clinical experts confirm matches between
            actual and LM-generated features. Our results highlight a promising direction with
            significant potential for improvement, positioning CTBench as a useful tool for
            advancing research on AI in CT design and potentially enhancing the efficacy and
            robustness of CTs.},
