  abstract={Biometric Authentication has become a very popular method for different state-of-the-art 
  security architectures. Albeit the ubiquitous acceptance and constant development in trivial biometric 
  authentication methods such as fingerprint, palm-print, retinal scan etc., the possibility of producing highly 
  competitive performance from somewhat less-popular methods still remains. Electrocardiogram (ECG) based multi-staged 
  biometric authentication is such a method, which, despite its limited appearance in earlier research works, 
  are currently being observed as equally high-performing as other trivial popular methods. The identification 
  stage of this method suffers from requiring a high runtime, due to cross-matching of the new data with every 
  single template data stored in the database, especially when dealing with huge amount of data. To solve this 
  unaddressed problem, in this paper, we have proposed a K-means clustering based novel method where all the template 
  data are clustered based on similarity, and only the most similar data cluster is searched instead of 
  whole dataset during the identification event. Using our method we have achieved a maximum of 79.26% time reduction with 100% accuracy.},

  With Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques in hand, researchers are now capable of studying biological

  trillions of sequences to align. But this comes at a cost of requiring computing machines having a tremendous amount of

  would not only cost an unnecessarily massive amount of money and labor but also would become troublesome to maintain. 
  Moreover, for aligning a huge number of DNA or Protein sequences a scalable multiple sequence alignment (MSA) algorithms 
  is needed with decent accuracy. In such context, this paper presents a novel implementation of Partial Order Alignment (POA) 
  algorithm on a multi-node Hadoop Cluster running on MapReduce framework. The implementation was done in Amazon AWS platform

  abstract={Social Networking sites have nowadays become the most common way to communicate

  remains an underlying friend recommendation framework which suggests friends to the users. 
  However, most of the existing friend recommendation frameworks consider only the number of 
  mutual friends, geo-location, mutual interests etc. to recommend one person as a friend to 
  another. But, in real life, people, who have similar personalities, tend to become friends to 
  each other, application of which is completely missing in the modern friend recommendation frameworks. 
  Hence, we have proposed a personality based friend recommendation framework in this paper, 
  which consists of a 3-Layered Artificial Neural Network for friend preference classification 
  and a distance-based sorted subset selection procedure for friend recommendation. 
  Our model tends to achieve a fairly high precision, recall, fl-measure and accuracy of

  abstract={Complex care management (CCM) or hot spotting programs identify and manage high-need/high-cost patients, 
  improving long-term health quality and medical costs. Typically, physicians refer patients to CCM. Despite strict 
  guidelines to ensure that eligible patients are placed in appropriate programs, such a provider-based approach is 
  limited by provider-capacity and the narrow view of a patient that a provider sees. We propose an ML workflow to 
  augment the provider-based approach, that can flag patients who are suited to CCM. Our predictor uses a global view 
  of a patient’s entire history across multiple providers and time to identify high-risk individuals from among all 
  the individuals in a matter of seconds. On a monthly basis, we evaluate our predictions against physician referrals. 
  In the test dataset, 41% of the top-500 highest risk individuals found by our model were referred to CCM by a physician 
  at some point in the 6-month window following our prediction (top-500 is a parameter that can be set to match the 
  CCM program’s capacity). Of those who were not referred in the 6-month window, 30% were referred at some time in their 
  trajectory. The remaining false positives had a greater than 95% similarity when compared to true positive physician 
  referrals in terms of cost profiles (both prior to referral and after referral) and patient profile. This remarkable 
  similarity suggests that our machine learning predictor can identify new candidates for complex care management and/or 
  predict referrals before a physician has an opportunity to do so.},

  abstract={We introduce CTBench, a benchmark to assess language models (LMs) in aiding
            clinical study design. Given metadata specific to a study, CTBench examines
            how well AI models can determine the baseline features of the clinical trial (CT)
            which include demographic and relevant features collected at the start of the trial
            from all participants. The baseline features, typically presented in CT publications
            (often as Table 1), are crucial for characterizing study cohorts and validating
            results. Baseline features, including confounders and covariates, are also required
            for accurate treatment effect estimation in studies involving observational data.
            CTBench consists of two datasets: "CT-Repo", containing baseline features from
            1, 690 clinical trials sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, and "CT-Pub", a subset
            of 100 trials with more comprehensive baseline features gathered from relevant
            publications. We develop two LM-based evaluation methods for evaluating the
            actual baseline feature lists against LM-generated responses. “ListMatch-LM”
            and “ListMatch-BERT” use GPT-4o and BERT scores (at various thresholds),
            respectively, to perform the evaluation. To establish baseline results, we apply
            advanced prompt engineering techniques using LLaMa3-70B-Instruct and GPT-4o
            in zero-shot and three-shot learning settings to generate potential baseline features.
            We validate the performance of GPT-4o as an evaluator through human-in-the-loop 
            evaluations on the CT-Pub dataset, where clinical experts confirm matches between
            actual and LM-generated features. Our results highlight a promising direction with

            robustness of CTs.},

To account for bias and healthcare usage changes due to the COVID-19
pandemic, we developed a hybrid matching approach that first identifies
the set of potential controls based on time and other critical features
and then applies matching methods. We compare results across seven
state-of-the-art methods including expert-informed approaches. We find
that HMP potentially improved subject health by more rapidly identi-
fying patients with undiagnosed T2D at enrollment, allowing for timely
treatment. After the initial two months, no significant differences are
observed in time to T2D onset. We also found that HMP patients were
