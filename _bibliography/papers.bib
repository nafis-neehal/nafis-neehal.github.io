  author={Neehal, Nafis and Wang, Bowen and Debopadhaya, Shayom and Dan, Soham and Murugesan, Keerthiram and Anand, Vibha and Bennett, Kristin P},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2406.17888},

  abstract={We introduce CTBench, a benchmark to assess language models (LMs) in aiding
            clinical study design. Given metadata specific to a study, CTBench examines
            how well AI models can determine the baseline features of the clinical trial (CT)
            which include demographic and relevant features collected at the start of the trial
            from all participants. The baseline features, typically presented in CT publications
            (often as Table 1), are crucial for characterizing study cohorts and validating
            results. Baseline features, including confounders and covariates, are also required
            for accurate treatment effect estimation in studies involving observational data.
            CTBench consists of two datasets: "CT-Repo", containing baseline features from
            1, 690 clinical trials sourced from clinicaltrials.gov, and "CT-Pub", a subset
            of 100 trials with more comprehensive baseline features gathered from relevant
            publications. We develop two LM-based evaluation methods for evaluating the
            actual baseline feature lists against LM-generated responses. “ListMatch-LM”
            and “ListMatch-BERT” use GPT-4o and BERT scores (at various thresholds),
            respectively, to perform the evaluation. To establish baseline results, we apply
            advanced prompt engineering techniques using LLaMa3-70B-Instruct and GPT-4o
            in zero-shot and three-shot learning settings to generate potential baseline features.
            We validate the performance of GPT-4o as an evaluator through human-in-the-loop 
            evaluations on the CT-Pub dataset, where clinical experts confirm matches between
            actual and LM-generated features. Our results highlight a promising direction with
            significant potential for improvement, positioning CTBench as a useful tool for
            advancing research on AI in CT design and potentially enhancing the efficacy and
            robustness of CTs.},
