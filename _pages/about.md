## About Me

As a **PhD candidate in Computer Science** at *Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute*, I have been solving complex challenges in healthcare—one of the most data-intensive industries—using advanced AI and machine learning techniques. With over **7 years of experience** in applied machine learning, deep learning, and data science, I specialize in developing, fine-tuning, and deploying large-scale models that drive real-world impact. 

My current work, particularly through collaborations with **IBM**, focuses on hybrid LLM architectures, RAG pipelines, and agentic systems, ensuring trustworthiness and mitigating hallucinations in AI-driven decision-making. My skills are transferable across industries.

## Research Focus

1. **LLMs in Clinical Trials**: Fine-tuning pre-trained state-of-the-art LLMs to optimize trial protocols and designs.
2. **LLM Benchmarking**: Spearheading the development of *CTBench*, a benchmark suite for evaluating LLMs in clinical contexts, ensuring reliability and precision in real-world applications.
3. **Hybrid LLM Architectures**: Developing RAG and agent-based approaches to better understand clinical texts and improve Q/A systems with *VectorDB* integrations.
4. **Trustworthy LLMs**: Ensuring reliability, safety, and mitigation of hallucinations in LLMs through RAG + Dynamic Prompting with guardrails and model validation techniques for high-stakes applications.
5. **Clinical Trial Equity**: Implementing state-of-the-art ML techniques to reduce patient recruitment costs by **25%** and ensure trial equity, as seen in the award-winning *FRESCA* framework.
