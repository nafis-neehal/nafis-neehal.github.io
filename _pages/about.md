## About Me

As a **PhD candidate in Computer Science** at *Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute*, I have been solving complex challenges in healthcare—one of the most data-intensive industries—using advanced AI and machine learning techniques. With over **7 years of experience** in applied machine learning, deep learning, and data science, I specialize in developing, fine-tuning, and deploying large-scale models that drive real-world impact.

Through industrial research collaborations, I currently bridge cutting-edge AI research with practical healthcare solutions. In collaboration with **IBM Research**, I lead the development of next-generation LLM frameworks for clinical trial automation, while my work with **CDPHP** focused on deploying ML systems that have processed over 22M+ patient records to improve healthcare delivery and risk prediction. My expertise in large-scale data processing, ML system optimization, and trustworthy AI architectures is domain-agnostic and directly transferable across industries. 

My research has been recognized at leading venues including ACM RecSys, AMIA, and Society for Clinical Trials, demonstrating the successful translation of academic innovation to industrial applications. Previously, as a lecturer at Daffodil International University, I established the institution's first AI Research Lab, mentoring future AI researchers and engineers.

## Research Focus

My research lies at the intersection of AI and Healthcare, with expertise in developing trustworthy and efficient systems. My work spans:

1. **LLM Development & Evaluation**
Led development of specialized clinical trial LLMs through quantized fine-tuning of Llama models on 65k+ trials, while engineering novel evaluation frameworks with hallucination-adjusted metrics for GPT-4/LLaMA-70B. Created comprehensive benchmarking infrastructure (CTBench) and implemented RAG architectures with few-shot learning, achieving 48.5% accuracy improvement in clinical trial feature generation tasks.

2. **ML Systems for Healthcare**
Engineered large-scale healthcare ML systems processing 22.5M+ patient records with 87-dimensional features, implementing deep autoencoders for efficient patient matching (35% faster, 40% memory reduction) and hybrid clustering algorithms for treatment effect analysis in 350K+ patient cohorts, while achieving 200x efficiency gain through PCA-based optimization for imbalanced healthcare data.

3. **Health Recommender Systems**
Developed fairness-aware patient matching frameworks improving treatment effect estimation accuracy by 75-80%, incorporating dual-adjustment pipelines for demographic alignment (96-99% improvement) and multi-stage survival analysis for outcome tracking. Engineered cost-efficient trial recruitment strategies demonstrating 25% reduction in expenses while maintaining equity.

4. **MLOps & System Architecture**
Architected end-to-end ML pipelines using AWS SageMaker, MLflow, and Docker, optimizing large-scale data processing with PySpark implementations achieving 60% faster processing. Developed distributed computing solutions with vector database integrations for enhanced retrieval systems, focusing on scalability and production-ready deployments.

## Beyond Research

Beyond research, I am passionate about developing cool AI applications. I enjoy reading with particular interests in human history and international politics, exploring how past events and current global dynamics shape our world. Love to travel around, love mountains, and trains (who doesn't, right?). I'm an avid consumer of sci-fi movies and tv-series, always wondering what future holds for us. Recently developed interest in Archery. Like to have interesting discussions with friends/strangers on Religion, God, Existence, Life and Philosophy. Also,like to play Blackjack, Codenames and Poker with friends.
